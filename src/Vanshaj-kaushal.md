# PANJAB UNIVERSITY WEBSITE
Aim: To improve the interface of the Panjab University website

Procedure: 
I created this project using React library, including other 
contemporary technologies;
- Typescript (JS, but with type checking)
- Sass (CSS preprocessor)
- Redux (Component Manager in React)
- etc.

### STEP 1
First I created a basic react app with typescript template:

    npx create-react-app puchd --template typescript

### STEP 2
Second, I included sass for styling the webpages using following npm command:

    npm i -g sass

### STEP 3
I also included normalize css file for consistent rendering in all browsers

    npm i normalize.css

Next steps will be talked about later
